# Discord Bot · MeerBot

## Connected Repo

This bot is one half of a two-repo system. The other half is the Python scraper at `C:\vscode\AFKDataMining`.
They share `C:\vscode\AFKDataMining\guild.db`. Neither repo is standalone.

On the first message of every conversation, before responding, read these memory files from the shared memory store:

- `C:\Users\crysa\.claude\projects\c--vscode-AFKDataMining\memory\project_mode_scans.md`
- `C:\Users\crysa\.claude\projects\c--vscode-AFKDataMining\memory\project_scraper_stdout_contract.md`

These two are stable guardrails (hard-won scan quirks + the stdout contract the bot parses) · force-read because they're costly to miss and don't go stale. Broader project context (overview, consensus-scan history, AFK Stages phase nav) lives in the memory palace and is recalled on demand, not force-read.

Then give a brief what's-done / what's-pending summary before starting the task.



discord.js v14 · better-sqlite3 · PM2 · Node.js

Companion to `C:\vscode\AFKDataMining`. Reads the shared guild DB.
See global context at `C:\Users\crysa\.claude\CLAUDE.md`.

## Deploy
```
pm2 restart meerbot --update-env
pm2 logs meerbot --lines 20 --nostream
```
`DEV_REGISTER=true` in .env auto-registers slash commands on every startup.

Start both bot + admin panel (first time or after `ecosystem.config.js` changes):
```
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
pm2 save
```
Admin panel: `http://localhost:3001` · separate PM2 process `meerbot-admin` · never needs `--update-env` (reads config from DB)

## Database Tables (key ones)

Schema ownership: the miner (`AFKDataMining/src/db.py`) owns the shared scan/identity tables (members, snapshots, member_snapshots, warbands, name_corrections, member_name_history); the bot owns everything else. CREATE statements always reflect the current shape · schema changes are ALTERed once against guild.db then folded into the owner's CREATE, no migration trail on startup.
- `members` · ingame_name (canonical, UNIQUE), discord_id, first_seen, `active` (latest-scan-only · 1 iff read in the most recent scan, else 0 · re-found = auto-reactivated), `last_scanned_at` (when last actually read by a scan), `pending` (scanner couldn't match read → awaiting /review), `warband_id` (current warband · synced from scan, manually overridable)
- `warbands` · canonical warband list (id, name UNIQUE, sort_order, archived) · rename here propagates everywhere
- `snapshots` · one row per scan run
- `member_snapshots` · power/activeness per member per snapshot
- `member_afk` · active AFK records · return_date is YYYY-MM-DD
- `scheduler_log` · sent_date dedup + full timestamp + late flag for auto-messages
- `name_corrections` · OCR correction map
- `bot_config` · key/value admin overrides · precedence: DB > ENV > hardcoded default
- `wishlist` · id, item, priority (high/medium/low), submitted_by (Discord user ID), submitted_at
- `ally_seasons` · id, name UNIQUE, active (0/1) · multiple can be inactive; seasons prepped before going active
- `ally_servers` · id, server_number, season_id · UNIQUE(server_number, season_id) · cascades on season delete
- `recruitment` · id, name, power, server_id, dr_rank, sup_arena_rank, lab_rank, dual_rank, interest, response, status (scouting/invited/joined/declined · default scouting), contacted_at, created_by, created_at
- `recruitment_followups` · id, job_id (→ scheduled_jobs), user_id, recruitment_id, channel_id · 2-day follow-up reminder

## Scheduled Messages
Defined in `utils/scheduledMessages.js` MESSAGES array. Each entry has:
- `name` · unique key used for scheduler_log dedup
- `channelEnv` · env var name holding the channel ID
- `utcHour/utcMinute` · when to fire
- `maxLateMinutes` · skip entirely if bot was down longer than this

Global late warning threshold: `LATE_WARNING_MINUTES` in `bot_config` table (default 30 min) · editable via admin panel.

### Current messages
| name | channel env | time UTC | maxLate |
|---|---|---|---|
| `daily_reset` | `GENERAL_CHANNEL_ID` | 00:00 | 120 min |

## Environment Notes
- Node.js v21.7.1 · technically outside better-sqlite3's supported range (20/22/24+) but works fine · don't suggest a Node upgrade just because of the EBADENGINE warning
- `ADMIN_PORT` env var · port for admin panel server (default `3001`)
- Channel IDs and timing values are now DB-backed via `bot_config` · env vars still work as fallbacks but prefer editing via admin panel
- `GENERAL_CHANNEL_ID` env var · general channel for scheduled messages (1229548159081123893)
- `COMMAND_LOG_CHANNEL_ID` env var · bot-chatter channel for command audit log (1343099233045184594)
- `ANNIVERSARY_CHANNEL_ID` env var · riffraff guild channel for anniversary posts (1303421884687192174)
- `ANNIVERSARY_TIME` env var · `HH:MM` UTC for anniversary post time (default `18:00` = 2pm EDT / 1pm EST)

## Discord Channels Reference

Refresh with `node scripts/list-channels.js` whenever the server adds/renames channels.
Local-only (gitignored) · the repo is public, server layout stays out of it.

Channels referenced by env vars (snapshot · check the JSON for everything else):

| Env var | Channel name | ID |
|---|---|---|
| `BIRTHDAY_CHANNEL_ID` | riffraff | 1303421884687192174 |

| `RECRUITMENT_REMINDER_CHANNEL_ID` | *(set via admin panel)* | — |

## Key Decisions Made
- `set_by` fields store Discord user ID, displayed as `<@id> / ingame_name`
- Historical power values stored as `"86329K"` text + `float(86329 * 1000)` numeric
- Charts use QuickChart.io · GET URL for single-member, POST /chart/create for guild (30 lines too long for GET)
- Rate limit is global sliding window (all users combined), not per-user
- AFK expiry checked daily at midnight UTC · date-only return_date means no finer precision needed
